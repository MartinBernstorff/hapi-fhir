# Server Interceptors

There are many different Pointcuts available to server developers. In general, a server can be thought of as playing two roles: Server and Storage.

In the case of a Plain Server, HAPI FHIR itself performs the role of the Server and your [Resource Provider](/docs/server_plain/resource_providers.html) classes perform the role of Storage.

In the case of a JPA Server, HAPI FHIR itself performs both roles. This means that **SERVER_xxx** Pointcuts may be intercepted by interceptors on any HAPI FHIR server. However, if you want to intercept **STORAGE_xxx** Pointcuts on a plain server, you will need to trigger them yourself.

# Registering Interceptors

How to register an interceptor differs depending on the type of pointcut it registers. For example, an interceptor hooking into a **STORAGE_xxx** will not be triggered if it is registered on the RestfulServer. 

### **SERVER_xxx**

|                 | Registered on |                     |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Call source** | RestfulServer | IInterceptorService |
| REST            | âœ…            | ðŸ”´                 |
| DAO             | ðŸ”´            | ðŸ”´                 |

### **STORAGE_xxx**
|                 | Registered on |                     |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Call source** | RestfulServer | IInterceptorService |
| REST            | âœ…            | âœ…                 |
| DAO             | ðŸ”´            | âœ…                 |

âœ…: Intercepted
ðŸ”´: Not intercepted

Note that you should not register any interceptor on both the `RestfulServer` and `IInterceptorService`. If you do so, it will be triggered twice.

# Example: Clearing Tags

The following example shows an interceptor that clears all tags, profiles, and security labels from a resource prior to storage in the JPA server.

```java
